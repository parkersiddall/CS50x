# CS50x
A collecton of solutions to the problem sets for Harvard's Intro to Computer Science course. 

I took the course in Spring 2020, the webpage for that version can be found here:

## Syllabus
- Week 0: Computative Thinking (Scratch)
- Week 1: C
- Week 2: Arrays
- Week 3: Algorithms
- Week 4: Memory
- Week 5: Data Structures
- Week 6: Python
- Week 7: SQL
- Week 8: Information & free track (I chose the Web track)

CS50 is known for being highly practical and pushing students to learn on their own. Each week includes a problem set which becomes increasingly more complex the course moves forward. Problem sets aim to simulate real world issues that can be solved with programming.
